# My Code Style Obsession

This repository collects my notes about my preferred code style.

I am obssesive with clear self-documented code, which is simple, consistent and readable for coauthors, readers, and the future self. 

My working projects use languages including Julia, MATLAB, Stata, $\LaTeX$, and Unix/Linux Shell Commands. I also use Make to automate workflow.
