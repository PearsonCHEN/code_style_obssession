# Julia

This document specifies my style conventions for Julia code. These conventions were collected from a variety of sources including Python's [PEP8](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008), Julia's [Notes for Contributors](https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md), and Julia's [Style Guide](https://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/style-guide/), Invenia's [BlueStyle](https://github.com/invenia/BlueStyle), Ismael's [Naming Guidance](https://github.com/JuliaPraxis/Naming) and QuantEcon's [Style Lecture](https://github.com/QuantEcon/lecture-source-jl/blob/master/style.md).
