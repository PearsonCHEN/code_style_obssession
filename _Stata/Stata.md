# Stata

#### Delimiter

The `#delimit ;` command resets the character `;` to mark the end of a command(instead of carriage return $\hookleftarrow$). It can be used **only** in do-files or ado-files(see [documentation](https://www.stata.com/manuals13/pdelimit.pdf)). Also, the Stata will reset the delimiter to carriage return automatically. Another good way to long line programming is simply using `///` at the end of each line separated from a long line.
